<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The main goal of this website is to help CossiePlay to reach out to more people. Cosplay is a rather new concept which Cossieplay aims to educate people about. As of now cossiePlay has only a few costumers a month, which they plan to, increase significantly with the help of this website. CossiePlay not only hopes to increase their costume customers from 4 a week, but also hope to attract more people to the parties they organize.

Another concern of CossiePlay is that their customer base is of the age group 35-50, which they would like to change. They hope to attract the younger generation and have a wider costumer base for their costumes and the parties.</p>
<p> So, in general this website should be designed to achieve what they desire and should appeal to all age groups starting from high school kids to a mature crowd. They would like more people to start Cosplaying. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The websites success can be evaluated if it actually manages to meet what the client desires. if CossiePlay is successful in having more people making costumes through them and there is an increase in the number of people attending their parties, we can assume that the website is successful. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target  audience would be starting from high school students to mature adults, who ever  can enjoy Cosplaying and also attend their parties. </p>
<h3>how can it be achieved? </h3>
<p>This can be achieved by providing all the important information regarding Cosplaying and Cossieplay. Another important factor would be the ease of usage (the UI) of the website which can appeal to all the groups targeted. </p>
